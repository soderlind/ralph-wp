Work in the current repo. Use these files as your source of truth:
- plans/prd.json
- progress.txt

1. Find the highest-priority feature to work on and work only on that feature.
   This should be the one YOU decide has the highest priority - not necessarily the first in the list.
2. Run checks:
   - npx wp-env start
   - composer lint
   - composer test (PHPUnit + Brain Monkey)
   - npm run build
3. Update the PRD with the work that was done (plans/prd.json).
4. Append your progress to progress.txt.
   Use this to leave a note for the next person working in the codebase.
5. Make a git commit of that feature.
ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE.
If, while implementing the feature, you notice the PRD is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
